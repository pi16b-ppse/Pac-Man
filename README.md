Legendary arcade game
The adaptation of arcade game designed by Toru Iwatani of Namco, and released in Japan as PUCKMAN in May 1980.

The player navigates Pac-Man through a dead-end-less maze containing dots, known as Pac-Dots, and some ghosts, who would do anything to disturb a hero. The goal of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible by collecting dots and fruits. When all of the dots in a stage are eaten, that stage is completed, and the player will advance to the next one.
